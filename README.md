Line Following Robot

INTRODUCTION:

As technology becomes increasingly important in today's world, it is invaluable to not only learn how to use technology, but also to understand the basics behind it in order to create new technology. Being an engineer, one should have the ability to observe nature to arrive at unconventional solutions for existing real world problems.

One of the most puzzling phenomena of nature is how ants always seem to follow an invisible path when in search of food. This path of theirs is very rarely disturbed even when encountered with unprecedented obstacles. This intriguing nature of ants can prove to be a solution for many problems in the fields of :
Industrial automated equipment carriers
Entertainment and small household applications.
Tour guides in museums and other similar applications.
Second wave reconnaissance operations.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Places of entertainment such as amusement parks, museums and art galleries attract huge crowds. Separate personnel are allocated in such areas to guide the people throughout the parks or museums since newcomers would find it difficult to navigate through such large establishments. Such guides usually follow a preset path, repeating it countless times throughout the day, rarely deviating. Such mundane tasks donâ€™t require the intelligence level of humans. If automated, these personnel can be shifted to other responsibilities for the betterment of the establishment.

In industries, manually operated carts are used to carry products from one manufacturing plant to another which are usually in different buildings or blocks spread over a wide area. Since it depends on the competence of the personnel involved, this can prove to be unreliable and inefficient. 
 
This project aims to automate such tasks, using carts programmed  to follow a line instead of the conventional method of laying railway tracks and allocating separate personnel which can both be costly and an inconvenience.
